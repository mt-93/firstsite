        <h3>Cooking</h3>
        <p class="food-paragraph">I never really used to cook at all until I decided it was time to get healthy.
          That's when I realised I was pretty darn good at it and I enjoy it. Cooking healthy food is my favourite
          especially when my default sometimes is to just binge eat junk food.</p>

        <h3>Making Coffee</h3>
        <p class="barista-paragraph">Probably seems like a bit of an 'odd skill' to add but for a bit context, I was a Barista for 3 of the UK's largest
        coffee chains over a 6 year period and I became pretty skilled at making coffee. In some of my roles training
        new Barista's was part of the job and this was where my skill was most put to use.</p>
